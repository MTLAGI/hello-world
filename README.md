I am an accomplished mathematician and currently working in IT.
I have a strong interest in: DW/BI, MI/AI, LAMP.
I am very interested in applied mathematics - the application of pure mathematics to solve real world problem.
Oh, didn't I mention that I wanted to write a GO program so that I can have some fun with it?
